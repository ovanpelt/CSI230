# Markdown file for project 2

I started the project by looking up what a markdown file was and how it should be used, 
then added a mark down file to my github and brought it over to my github folder on my vm

I then lookedup some background on for loops that read through files on 
https://developpaper.com/how-to-read-each-line-of-a-file-using-a-shell-script-loop/

then i did a quick refresher of how to manipulate a string found at
https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/07/bash-string-manipulation/

looked up how to use the openssl for generating passwords on
https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.2/man1/rand.html

I then loooked for a way to check if a user was in a group or not using the grep command here
https://bytefreaks.net/gnulinux/bash/linux-check-if-a-user-or-a-group-exists

Then I researched some things on the chage command at this website
https://www.tecmint.com/force-user-to-change-password-next-login-in-linux/

Right around here is where i had my second mental breakdown because none of the passwords I made worked
